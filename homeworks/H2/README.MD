### Implementation

The key for XORing is generated by taking the seconds from the system time (as 1 byte). Each character of the input string is XORed with the key. Both the key and the encrypted string are written to an output file. I used `fisio.h` for the file I/O operations in Assembly.

### Commands for compiling & link-editing & executing the C code with Turbo C in DOSBox (relative to this directory)

`..\..\TC\BIN\TCC.EXE -ml -c C_ENC.C`<br>
`..\..\TC\BIN\TLINK.EXE ..\..\TC\LIB\C0L.OBJ + C_ENC.OBJ, C_ENC.EXE, , ..\..\TC\LIB\CL.LIB`<br>
`C_ENC.EXE`

### Observations

- The `-ml` flag is used to enable large memory model in order to bypass the 64KB limit of the default memory model.
- The `C0L.OBJ` file is used to link the C standard library functions.
- The `CL.LIB` file is used to link the Turbo C library functions.
